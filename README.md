# Micro Reddit (Ruby on Rails)

>  Building User Models, Post, and Comment models


In this project, we build the data structures necessary to support link submissions and commenting

## Built With

- Ruby language,
- Ruby on Rails framework,
- Vscode for coding
- Rubocop for Validation


## Getting Started

**start by generating the application skeleton using the rails new command with a specific Rails version number:

$ cd ~/environment
$ rails _6.0.1_ new sample_app
$ cd micro_reddit/

**Next, we’ll use a text editor to update the Gemfile needed by Bundler.**
**install the local gems while preventing the installation of production gems using the --without production option:

**$ bundle install --without production.**

**$ Generate the Models**
** Use 
rails generate model Modelname
to generate the models you need. Endeavour to include your table columns, and the associations


** Then run rails db:migrate to create your tables in the database
